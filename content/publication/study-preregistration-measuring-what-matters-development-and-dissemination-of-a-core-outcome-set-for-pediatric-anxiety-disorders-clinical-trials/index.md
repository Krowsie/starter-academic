abstract: Pediatric anxiety disorders (AD) are prevalent disorders with an
  impact on all aspects of a child's life and functioning.1 Although evidence
  supports commonly used treatments, there are notable concerns with the
  research to date.2 Heterogeneity in outcome selection, measurement, analysis,
  and reporting is a contributing factor to the hinderance of the translation of
  research into clinical practice.3 Recognition for outcome standardization in
  pediatric mental health disorders is evolving and there are several
  initiatives of importance, including the International Consortium for Health
  Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM), which has developed standardized outcome sets
  for use in the routine clinical mental health treatment of children and
  adolescents.4 Similarly, the International Alliance of Mental Health Research
  Funders5 advocate for use of 1 specific outcome measurement instrument (OMI)
  in the youth mental health research that they fund. Development of a Core
  Outcome Set (COS), a minimal set of outcomes that should be measured and
  reported in clinical trials, has been a solution in other areas of medicine to
  address heterogeneity in outcome selection and measurement across trials.6 The
  Core Outcomes and Measures in Pediatric Anxiety Clinical Trials (COMPACT)
  Initiative will develop a harmonized, evidence- and consensus-based COS that
  is meaningful to youth and families for use in future trials in pediatric AD.
