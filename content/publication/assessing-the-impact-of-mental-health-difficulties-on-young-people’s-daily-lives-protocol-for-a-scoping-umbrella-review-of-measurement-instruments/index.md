abstract: "An important consideration for determining the severity of mental
  health symptoms is their impact on youth’s daily lives. Those wishing to
  assess ‘life impact’ face several challenges: First, various measurement
  instruments are available, including of global functioning, health-related
  quality of life and well-being. Existing reviews have tended to focus on one
  of these domains; consequently, a comprehensive overview is lacking. Second,
  the extent to which such instruments truly capture distinct concepts is
  unclear. Third, many available scales conflate symptoms and their impact, thus
  undermining much needed analyses of associations between the two. A scoping
  umbrella review will examine existing reviews of life impact measures for use
  with children and youth aged 6–24 years in the context of mental health and
  well-being research. We will systematically search six bibliographic databases
  (MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the COSMIN
  database of systematic reviews of outcome measurement instruments), and
  conduct systematic record screening, data extraction and charting based on
  methodological guidance by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Data synthesis will
  involve the tabulation of scale characteristics, feasibility and measurement
  properties, and the use of summary statistics to synthesise how these
  instruments operationalise life impact. The protocol was registered
  prospectively with the Open Science Framework (osf.io/ers48)."
