  Introduction: An important consideration for determining the severity of
  mental health symptoms is their impact on youthâ€™s daily lives. Those wishing
  to assess life impact face several challenges: First, various measurement
  instruments are available, including of global functioning, health-related
  quality of life (HRQoL), and well-being. Existing reviews have tended to focus
  on one of these domains; consequently, a comprehensive overview is lacking.
  Second, the extent to which such instruments truly capture distinct concepts
  is unclear. Third, many available scales conflate symptoms and their impact,
  thus undermining much needed analyses of associations between the two.


  Methods and analysis: A scoping umbrella review will examine existing reviews of life impact measures for use with 6-24-year-olds in the context of mental health and well-being research. We will systematically search five bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science), and conduct systematic record screening, data extraction and charting based on methodological guidance by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Data synthesis will involve the tabulation of scale characteristics, feasibility, and measurement properties, and the use of summary statistics to synthesize how these instruments operationalize life impact.


  Ethics and dissemination: This study will provide a comprehensive road map for researchers and clinicians seeking to assess life impact in youth mental health, providing guidance in navigating available measurement options. We will seek to publish the findings in a leading peer-reviewed journal in the field. Formal research ethics approval will not be required.
