abstract: To make decisions in mental health care, service users, clinicians,
  and administrators need to make sense of research findings. Unfortunately,
  study results are often presented as raw questionnaire scores at different
  time points and regression coefficients, which are difficult to interpret with
  regards to their clinical meaning. Other commonly reported treatment outcome
  indicators in clinical trials or meta-analyses do not convey whether a given
  change score would make a noticeable difference to service users. There is an
  urgent need to improve the interpretability and relevance of outcome
  indicators in youth mental health (aged 12â€“24 years), in which shared decision
  making and person-centred care are cornerstones of an ongoing global
  transformation of care. In this Personal View, we make a case for considering
  minimally important change (MIC) as a meaningful, accessible, and user-centred
  outcome indicator. We discuss what the MIC represents, how it is calculated,
  and how it can be implemented in dialogues between clinician and researcher,
  and between youth and clinician. We outline how use of the MIC could enhance
  reporting in clinical trials, meta-analyses, clinical practice guidelines, and
  measurement-based care. Finally, we identify current methodological challenges
  around estimating the MIC and areas for future research. Efforts to select
  outcome domains and valid measurement instruments that resonate with youth,
  families, and clinicians have increased in the past 5 years. In this context,
  now is the time to define demarcations of changes in outcome scores that are
  clinically relevant, and meaningful to youth and families. Through the use of
  MIC, youth-centred outcome measurement, analysis, and reporting would support
  youth-centred therapeutic decision making.
