abstract: "Background: Many young people with anxiety or depression drop out of
  treatment early, and/or leave treatment without showing measurably improved
  symptom levels. To enhance treatment engagement and effectiveness, it is
  critical to better understand how young people’s perceptions of the symptoms,
  causes, consequences, treatability, and course of their anxiety and depression
  influence engagement. Aim: This study aimed to provide a qualitative account
  of illness perceptions among youth with anxiety and depression by applying the
  Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM), which was developed in physical
  health contexts. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26
  young people (aged 16–24, 73% female) with a history of anxiety and/or
  depression. Interviews were analysed using a combination of theory- and
  data-driven analysis techniques, consisting primarily of deductive thematic
  analysis. Results: The five themes broadly mapped onto the dimensions of the
  CSM, suggesting parallels in how mental and physical health problems are
  perceived. Anxiety and depression were viewed as non-linear, relapsing and
  remitting, but lifelong conditions, with a fluctuating and complex path to
  recovery and coping. Youth described pervasive negative impacts on their
  lives, but also described some positive aspects. Implications: Better
  understanding of young people’s illness beliefs has the potential to open a
  range of intervention possibilities by prioritizing young people’s illness
  perceptions over the clinician’s understanding and the supposed objective
  condition severity and trajectory. Although this study supported a common
  structure of illness beliefs, the content of these beliefs was idiosyncratic
  and specific to anxiety and depression, suggesting the need to develop a valid
  tool to measure illness perceptions in this group. Practitioner points: Our
  findings suggest that illness perceptions are complex, highly idiosyncratic,
  and specific to youth anxiety and depression. Given the complexity of these
  beliefs and the known association with important treatment- and health-related
  outcomes, it is important that clinical formulation incorporates young
  people’s illness belief models, including their perceptions of symptoms,
  cause, timeline to recovery, consequences, and personal and treatment control.
  To increase help-seeking, treatment engagement and adaptive coping strategies,
  therapy should work to a shared understanding of illness beliefs. Increasing
  congruence between the belief models of young people, families, and clinicians
  may serve to improve treatment benefits and address the unmet mental health
  needs of young people. "
