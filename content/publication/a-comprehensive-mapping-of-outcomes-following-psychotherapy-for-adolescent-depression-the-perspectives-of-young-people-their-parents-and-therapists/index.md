abstract: As mental health systems move towards person-centred care, outcome
  measurement in clinical research and practice should track changes that matter
  to young people and their families. This study mapped the types of change
  described by three key stakeholder groups following psychotherapy for
  depression, and compared the salience of these outcomes with the frequency of
  their measurement in recent quantitative treatment effectiveness studies for
  adolescent depression. Using qualitative content analysis, this study
  identified and categorized outcomes across 102 semi-structured interviews that
  were conducted with depressed adolescents, their parents, and therapists, as
  part of a randomized superiority trial. Adolescents had been allocated to
  Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Short-Term Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy, or a
  Brief Psychosocial Intervention. The study mapped seven high-level outcome
  domains and 29 outcome categories. On average, participants discussed change
  in four domains and six outcome categories. The most frequently discussed
  outcome was an improvement in mood and affect (i.e., core depressive
  symptoms), but close to half of the participants also described changes in
  family functioning, coping and resilience, academic functioning, or social
  functioning. Coping had specific importance for adolescents, while parents and
  therapists showed particular interest in academic functioning. There was some
  variation in the outcomes discussed beyond these core themes, across
  stakeholder groups and treatment arms. Of the outcomes that were frequently
  discussed in stakeholder narratives, only symptomatic change has been commonly
  reported in recent treatment studies for adolescent depression. A shift
  towards considering multiple outcome domains and perspectives is needed to
  reflect stakeholder priorities and enable more nuanced insights into change
  processes.
