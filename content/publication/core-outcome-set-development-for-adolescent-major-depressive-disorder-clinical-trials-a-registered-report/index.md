abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD), associated with a lifetime prevalence
  rate of 11% in adolescents, results in significant disease burden worldwide.
  Adolescent MDD clinical trials evaluate interventions by measuring the effects
  of the interventions on various treatment outcomes, such as “severity of
  depressive symptoms” or “social functioning.” The ability to compare or
  contrast treatments and to generate usable, meaningful data, however, depends
  on trials using well-selected and well-defined outcomes measured by validated
  tools. To ensure comparability between trials, core outcome sets (COS) have
  been developed for use in other healthcare areas, which has resulted in
  improved standardization of outcome selection and measurement across
  effectiveness trials, facilitating the synthesis of results in systematic
  reviews. A COS is an agreed-upon, standardized minimum set of outcomes that
  should be measured and reported in all clinical trials in specific areas of
  health, while not precluding the inclusion of other outcomes. More recently, a
  growing awareness of the importance of COS has led to greater patient
  engagement in outcome selection and measurement, resulting in a stronger
  emphasis on quality of life and functional outcomes as being critical to
  evaluate. The primary objective of this project will be to develop an
  evidence- and consensus-based COS for adolescent MDD clinical trials assessing
  any type of intervention by following COS development methodology
  recommendations from the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET)
  Initiative. Innovative adaptations to ensure engagement of youth and
  caregivers will be used throughout this project; thus, a secondary objective
  is to develop guidance for incorporating youth and family engagement in the
  development of COS for adolescent mental health.
