abstract: Mental health research grapples with research waste and stunted field
  progression caused by inconsistent outcome measurement across studies and
  clinical settings, which means there is no common language for considering
  findings. Although recognising that no gold standard measures exist and that
  all existing measures are flawed in one way or another, anxiety and depression
  research is spearheading a common metrics movement to harmonise measurement,
  with several initiatives over the past 5 years recommending the consistent use
  of specific scales to allow read-across of measurements between studies. For
  this approach to flourish, however, common metrics must be acceptable and
  adaptable to a range of contexts and populations, and global access should be
  as easy and affordable as possible, including in low-income countries. Within
  a measurement landscape dominated by fixed proprietary measures and with
  competing views of what should be measured, achieving this goal poses a range
  of challenges. In this Personal View, we consider tensions between
  affordability, sustainability, consistency, and adaptability that, if not
  addressed, risk undermining the common metrics agenda. We outline a
  three-pronged way forward that involves funders taking more direct
  responsibility for measure development and dissemination; a move towards
  managing measure dissemination and adaptation via open-access measure hubs;
  and transitioning from fixed questionnaires to item banks. We argue that now
  is the time to start thinking of mental health metrics as 21st century tools
  to be co-owned and co-created by the mental health community, with support
  from dedicated infrastructure, coordinating bodies, and funders.
