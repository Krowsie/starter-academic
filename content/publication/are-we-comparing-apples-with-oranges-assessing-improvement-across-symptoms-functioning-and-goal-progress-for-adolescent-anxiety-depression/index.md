abstract: Strategies for comparing routinely collected outcome data across
  services or systems include focusing on a common indicator (e.g., symptom
  change) or aggregating results from different measures or outcomes into a
  comparable core metric. The implications of either approach for judging
  treatment success are not fully understood. This study drew on naturalistic
  outcome data from 1641 adolescents with moderate or severe anxiety and/or
  depression symptoms who received routine specialist care across 60 mental
  health services in England. The study compared rates of meaningful improvement
  between the domains of internalizing symptoms, functioning, and progress
  towards self-defined goals. Consistent cross-domain improvement was observed
  in only 15.6% of cases. Close to one in four (24.0%) young people with
  reliably improved symptoms reported no reliable improvement in functioning.
  Inversely, one in three (34.8%) young people reported meaningful goal progress
  but no reliable symptom improvement. Monitoring systems that focus exclusively
  on symptom change risk over- or under-estimating actual impact, while
  aggregating different outcomes into a single metric can mask informative
  differences in the number and type of outcomes showing improvement. A move
  towards harmonized outcome measurement approaches across multiple domains is
  needed to ensure fair and meaningful comparisons.
