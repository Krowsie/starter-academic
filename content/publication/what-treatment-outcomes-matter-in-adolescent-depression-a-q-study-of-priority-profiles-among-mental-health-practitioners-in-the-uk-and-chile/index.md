abstract: "Evidence-based and person-centred care requires the measurement of
  treatment outcomes that matter to youth and mental health practitioners.
  Priorities, however, may vary not just between but also within stakeholder
  groups. This study used Q-methodology to explore differences in outcome
  priorities among mental health practitioners from two countries in relation to
  youth depression. Practitioners from the United Kingdom (UK) (n = 27) and
  Chile (n = 15) sorted 35 outcome descriptions by importance and completed
  brief semi-structured interviews about their sorting rationale. By-person
  principal component analysis (PCA) served to identify distinct priority
  profiles within each country sample; second-order PCA examined whether these
  profiles could be further reduced into cross-cultural “super profiles”. We
  identified three UK outcome priority profiles (Reduced symptoms and enhanced
  well-being; improved individual coping and self-management; improved family
  coping and support), and two Chilean profiles (Strengthened identity and
  enhanced insight; symptom reduction and self-management). These could be
  further reduced into two cross-cultural super profiles: one prioritized
  outcomes related to reduced depressive symptoms and enhanced well-being; the
  other prioritized outcomes related to improved resilience resources within
  youth and families. A practitioner focus on symptom reduction aligns with a
  long-standing focus on symptomatic change in youth depression treatment
  studies, and with recent measurement recommendations. Less data and guidance
  are available to those practitioners who prioritize resilience outcomes. To
  raise the chances that such practitioners will engage in evidence-based
  practice and measurement-based care, measurement guidance for a broader set of
  outcomes may be needed."
