abstract: Registry-based randomized controlled trials (RRCTs) have potential to
  address limitations of traditional clinical trials. To describe their current
  use, information on planned and published RRCTs was identified and
  synthesized. A scoping review of published RRCT protocols and reports was
  conducted. Articles published between 2010 and 2021 identified from electronic
  database searching, a recent review of RRCTs, and targeted searching for
  recent RRCT protocols (2018â€“2021) were screened. Data on trial data sources,
  types of primary outcomes, and how these primary outcomes were described,
  selected, and reported were extracted. Ninety RRCT articles (77 reports; 13
  protocols) were included. Forty nine (54%) used or planned to rely on registry
  data for their trial, 26 (29%) used both registry and additional data, and 15
  (17%) used the registry solely for recruitment. Primary outcomes were
  routinely collected from the registry for 66 articles (73%). Only 28 articles
  (31%) described any methods to promote outcome data quality during or after
  data collection. Core outcome sets were not used in any of the trials. With
  improvements in registry design, outcome selection, measurement, and
  reporting, future RRCTs may deliver on promises of efficient, high-quality
  trials that address clinically relevant questions.
