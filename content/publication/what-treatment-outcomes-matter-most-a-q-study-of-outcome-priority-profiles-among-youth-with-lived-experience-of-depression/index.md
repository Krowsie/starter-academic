abstract: Registry-based randomized controlled trials (RRCTs) are increasingly
  used, promising to address challenges associated with traditional randomized
  controlled trials. We identified strengths and limitations reported in planned
  and completed RRCTs to inform future RRCTs. We conducted an environmental scan
  of literature discussing conceptual or methodological strengths and
  limitations of using registries for trial design and conduct (n = 12),
  followed by an analysis of RRCT protocols (n = 13) and reports (n = 77)
  identified from a scoping review. Using framework analysis, we developed and
  refined a conceptual framework of RRCT-specific strengths and limitations. We
  mapped and interpreted strengths and limitations discussed by authors of RRCT
  articles using framework codes and quantified the frequencies at which these
  were mentioned. Our conceptual framework identified six main RRCT strengths
  and four main RRCT limitations. Considering implications for RRCT conduct and
  design, we formulated ten recommendations for registry designers,
  administrators, and trialists planning future RRCTs.  Consideration and
  application of empirically underpinned recommendations for future registry
  design and trial conduct may help trialists utilize registries and RRCTs to
  their full potential.
