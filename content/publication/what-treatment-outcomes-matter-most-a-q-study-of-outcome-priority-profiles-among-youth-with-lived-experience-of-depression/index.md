abstract: "Interest in youth perspectives on what constitutes an important
  outcome in the treatment of depression has been growing, but limited attention
  has been given to heterogeneity in outcome priorities, and minority
  viewpoints. These are important to consider for person-centred outcome
  tracking in clinical practice, or when conducting clinical trials targeting
  specific populations. This study used Q-methodology to identify outcome
  priority profiles among youth with lived experience of service use for
  depression. A purposive sample of 28 youth (aged 16–21 years) rank-ordered 35
  outcome statements by importance and completed brief semi-structured
  interviews eliciting their sorting rationales. By-person principal component
  analysis was used to identify outcome priority profiles based on all Q-sort
  configurations. Priority profiles were described and interpreted with
  reference to the qualitative interview data. Four distinct outcome priority
  profiles were identified: “Relieving distress and experiencing a happier
  emotional state”; “Learning to cope with cyclical distressing emotional
  states”; “Understanding and processing distressing emotional states”; and
  “Reduced interference of ongoing distressing emotional states with daily
  life”. All four profiles prioritized improvements in mood and the ability to
  feel pleasure but differed in the level of importance assigned to learning
  coping skills, processing experiences, and the reduced interference of
  depression with life and identity. As part of a person-centered approach to
  care delivery, care providers should routinely engage young people in
  conversation and shared decision-making about the types of change they would
  like to prioritize and track during treatment, beyond a common core of
  consensus outcomes."
