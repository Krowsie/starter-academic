  Objective: Over the past years, interest in youth perspectives on what
  constitutes an important outcome in the treatment of depression has been
  growing, but limited attention has been given to heterogeneity in outcome
  priorities and minority viewpoints. These are important to consider for
  person-centered outcome tracking in clinical practice, or when conducting
  clinical trials targeting specific populations. This study used Q-methodology
  to identify outcome priority profiles among youth with lived experience of
  service use for depression. 
  	
  Method: A purposive sample of 28 youth (aged 16–21 years) rank-ordered 35 outcomes by importance and completed brief semi-structured interviews eliciting their sorting rationales. By-person principal component analysis was used to identify outcome priority profiles based on all Q-sort configurations. Priority profiles were described and interpreted with reference to the qualitative interview data.


  Results: Four distinct outcome priority profiles were identified: “symptom reduction and enhanced well-being”; “improved coping and self-management”; “better understanding past and present”; and “less interference with daily life”. All four profiles prioritized outcomes related to improved mood and affect over other outcome concepts. Beyond these core outcomes, profiles differed in the level of importance assigned to learning practical coping skills, processing experiences, finding safe ways to articulate emotions, and reduced interference of depression with life and identity.


  Conclusion: As part of a person-centered approach to care delivery, care providers should routinely engage young people in conversation and shared decision-making about the types of change they would like to prioritize and track during treatment, beyond a common core of consensus outcomes.
