abstract: "A major barrier to improving care effectiveness for mental health is
  a lack of consensus on outcomes measurement. The International Consortium for
  Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) has already developed a consensus-based
  standard set of outcomes for anxiety and depression in adults (including the
  Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale,
  and the WHO Disability Schedule). This Position Paper reports on
  recommendations specifically for anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive
  disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder in children and young people aged
  between 6 and 24 years. An international ICHOM working group of 27 clinical,
  research, and lived experience experts formed a consensus through
  teleconferences, an exercise using an adapted Delphi technique (a method for
  reaching group consensus), and iterative anonymous voting, supported by
  sequential research inputs. A systematic scoping review identified 70 possible
  outcomes and 107 relevant measurement instruments. Measures were appraised for
  their feasibility in routine practice (ie, brevity, free availability,
  validation in children and young people, and language translation) and
  psychometric performance (ie, validity, reliability, and sensitivity to
  change). The final standard set recommends tracking symptoms, suicidal
  thoughts and behaviour, and functioning as a minimum through seven primarily
  patient-reported outcome measures: the Revised Children's Anxiety and
  Depression Scale, the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory for Children, the
  Children's Revised Impact of Events Scale, the Columbia Suicide Severity
  Rating Scale, the KIDSCREEN-10, the Children's Global Assessment Scale, and
  the Child Anxiety Life Interference Scale. The set's recommendations were
  validated through a feedback survey involving 487 participants across 45
  countries. The set should be used alongside the anxiety and depression
  standard set for adults with clinicians selecting age-appropriate measures."
