abstract: The Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ) and the Suicidal Ideation
  Questionnaire- Junior (SIQ-Jr) were designed to capture suicidal ideation in
  adolescents and are often used in clinical trials. Our aim was to identify and
  appraise the published literature with respect to the validity, reliability,
  responsiveness and interpretability of the SIQ and SIQ-Jr. We conducted a
  systematic review following COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of
  health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) guidelines to identify, appraise and
  synthesize published literature on measurement properties and interpretability
  of the SIQ and SIQ-Jr. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web
  of Science, and Scopus from inception to May 16th, 2023 to identify sources
  relevant to our aim. We identified 15 sources meeting our eligibility
  criteria. The body of literature did not meet COSMIN standards to make
  recommendations for use with regards to these measurement instruments. Further
  research is needed, with a focus on content validity and structural validity,
  prior to recommending the SIQ and SIQ-Jr for use in clinical practice and in
  clinical trials. No specific grant funding was used for this review.
