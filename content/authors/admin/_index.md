title: Karolin Krause
role: Post-Doctoral Researcher
bio: My current work focuses on bringing the personal into personalized medicine: Using mixed methods and an interdisciplinary approach, I explore avenues for incorporating patients’ psychosocial and contextual characteristics (“personomics”) into the tailoring of treatment plans, moving beyond the current focus on biological markers. Previously, my research has focused on strengthening approaches to outcome measurement in youth mental health, with a focus on functional impairment, and the development of core outcome sets for youth depression and anxiety.

I am a post-doctoral researcher with the METHODS Team at the Centre of Research in Epidemiology and StatisticS (CRESS UMR 1153) in Paris where my work focuses on bringing the person as a whole back into personalized medicine. Using mixed methods and an interdisciplinary approach, I explore avenues for incorporating patients’ psychosocial characteristics (“personomics”) into the tailoring of treatment plans. 

In parallel, I complete postdoctoral research with the Cundill Centre for Child and Youth Depression at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto, where I focus on strengthening approaches to outcome measurement in youth mental health, with a focus on functional impairment and the development of core outcome sets for youth mental health.
