I am a post-doctoral research fellow with the Cundill Centre for Child and Youth Depression at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, and an honorary fellow with University College London. My research focuses on strengthening outcome measurement in youth mental health, with a focus on consistency, youth-centredness, and the assessment of functional impairment. I like to use mixed methods and am interested in global perspectives on mental health. Prior to my PhD at UCL, I was a programme evaluator in the UK international development sector working primarily on girls' education and empowerment programmes.
