I am a post-doctoral research fellow with the Cundill Centre for Child and Youth Depression at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, and an honorary fellow with the Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology at University College London. My research focuses on strengthening outcome measurement in youth mental health, with a focus on consistency, youth-centeredness, and the assessment of functional impairment. I like to use mixed methods and am interested in global perspectives on mental health.
