title: COMPACT - Core Outcomes and Measures in Paediatric Anxiety Clinical Trials
subtitle: Co-Investigator
date: 2024-01-05T12:24:47.624Z
summary: This project plans to develop, an evidence- and consensus-based COS for
  pediatric anxiety disorder trials with active engagement of youth and family
  members and other stakeholders. We will identify outcomes used in the
  literature and engage with youth and family through virtual workshops, to
  understand what they view as important outcomes. With a list of outcomes, we
  will use a consensus process to help us develop decisions on what to measure
  across future trials.
