Between October 2018 and March 2020, the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) convened an international working group of 27 experts by profession or lived experience from 13 countries to develop a standard set of outcomes for child and youth anxiety, depression, OCD and PTSD. Through a modified Delphi-consultation and iterative anonymous voting, the working group reached consensus on a standard set of outcome domains, measurement instruments, case-mix factors, and measurement time points. The standard set is the first global guidance for measuring outcomes for pediatric anxiety and depression (including OCD and PTSD) in clinical practice, and a first step towards  harmonizing measurement approaches.
